# Reasoning Tokens - Quick Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

Your agent now supports OpenRouter reasoning tokens according to their official specification.

## What Changed

### **3 Key Additions:**

1. **Request Parameter** (Line 1320-1323)
   ```python
   reasoning={
       "effort": "medium",
       "exclude": False
   }
   ```

2. **Token Collection** (Lines 1334-1352)
   ```python
   # Collect reasoning as it streams
   if hasattr(delta, 'reasoning') and delta.reasoning:
       reasoning_buffer += delta.reasoning
       yield {"type": "reasoning_token", "token": delta.reasoning}
   ```

3. **Preservation** (Lines 1397-1427)
   ```python
   # Save reasoning_details for context
   if reasoning_details_buffer:
       assistant_message_dict["reasoning_details"] = reasoning_details_buffer
   ```

## New Event Type

**`reasoning_token`** - Streams the model's thinking process:
```json
{
  "type": "reasoning_token",
  "token": "Let me analyze this step by step..."
}
```

## Example Output

```
🧠 REASONING: "First, I need to get the hazard data..."
🔧 Using tool: get_data_summary
🧠 REASONING: "Now I'll find the top hazards..."
🔧 Using tool: get_top_values
🧠 REASONING: "I should search for OSHA standards..."
🔧 Using tool: search_web
💬 ANSWER: "Your top hazards are..."
```

## Supported Models

✅ Claude 3.7+, Claude 4, Claude 4.1  
✅ OpenAI o1/o3/GPT-5 series  
✅ Grok reasoning models  
✅ Gemini Flash Thinking  
✅ Alibaba Qwen thinking models  

## Configuration

**Current default:** `"effort": "medium"` (balanced)

**Change to:**
- `"high"` - Deep thinking (complex queries)
- `"low"` - Quick thinking (simple queries)
- `"exclude": True` - Hide reasoning from user

## Cost Note

⚠️ Reasoning tokens count as **output tokens** for billing.

## Files Modified

- ✅ `tool_agent.py` - Added reasoning support
- ✅ `REASONING_TOKENS_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Full documentation
- ✅ `REASONING_QUICK_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Ready to Use

No additional setup needed. The agent will automatically use reasoning for supported models! 🎉
