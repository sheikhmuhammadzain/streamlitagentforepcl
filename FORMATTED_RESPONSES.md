### 2. **💡 Insights**
- What the data means
- Root causes and contributing factors
- Business impact analysis

### 3. **📈 Recommendations**
- Actionable next steps (prioritized)
- Areas requiring attention
- Specific, data-driven suggestions

### 4. **📋 Summary**
- Brief overview of the analysis

- Structured data (tables/lists)

---

## ✨ Formatting Features

### Visual Elements
```markdown
✅ Emojis for quick scanning (📊 📈 💡 ⚠️ ✅)
✅ **Bold** for important numbers and metrics
✅ Bullet points for easy reading

✅ Headings (##) for organization
```

### Example Response

```markdown
## 📊 Key Findings

- **Total Incidents**: 1,247 recorded incidents
- **Top Department**: Operations with **342 incidents** (27.4%)
- **Trend**: **15% increase** compared to last quarter
- **Peak Month**: March 2024 with **156 incidents**

## 💡 Insights

- Operations department shows significantly higher incident rate due to:
  - High-risk activities (machinery operation)
  - Larger workforce (450 employees)
  - Extended operating hours (24/7 shifts)

- Seasonal pattern detected:
  - Q1 shows **20% higher** incident rates
  - Likely due to new employee onboarding in January

## 📈 Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action**: Conduct safety audit in Operations department
   - Focus on machinery operation procedures
   - Review training effectiveness

2. **Short-term** (1-3 months):
   - Implement enhanced onboarding safety program
   - Increase supervision during Q1 period

3. **Long-term** (3-6 months):
   - Deploy predictive safety monitoring system
   - Establish monthly safety review meetings

## 📋 Summary

| Metric | Value | Change |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Total Incidents | 1,247 | +15% |
| Top Department | Operations | 342 incidents |
| Average per Month | 104 | +12 vs last year |

**Key Takeaway**: Operations department requires immediate attention with a 27.4% incident share and rising trend.

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. System Prompt Instructions
The agent receives detailed formatting guidelines in its system prompt:

```python
RESPONSE FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
When providing your final answer, format it using Markdown with the following structure:

## 📊 Key Findings
- List the most important data points with **exact numbers**
...

FORMATTING RULES:
✅ Use **bold** for important numbers and metrics
✅ Use bullet points (•) for lists
✅ Use emojis for visual clarity
...
```

### 2. Automatic Enhancement
If the model doesn't format properly, the `enhance_response_formatting()` function adds structure:

```python
def enhance_response_formatting(response: str) -> str:
    # Check if already formatted
    has_sections = any(marker in response for marker in ["## 📊", "## 💡", "## 📈", "## 📋"])
    
    if has_sections:
        return response  # Already good
    
    # Add basic structure
    formatted = "## 📊 Analysis Results\n\n"
    formatted += response
    ...
```

---

## 📊 Benefits

### For Users
✅ **Scannable** - Quick visual hierarchy  
✅ **Actionable** - Clear recommendations  
✅ **Professional** - Consistent formatting  
✅ **Complete** - All sections covered  

### For Developers
✅ **Consistent** - Same structure every time  
✅ **Parseable** - Easy to extract sections  
✅ **Extensible** - Add new sections easily  
✅ **Reliable** - Fallback formatting  

---

## 🎯 Best Practices

### When Asking Questions

**Good Questions** (get better formatted responses):
```
✅ "Analyze top 10 departments by incident count"
✅ "Show hazard trends with recommendations"
✅ "Compare incident rates across locations with insights"
```

**Less Optimal**:
```
❌ "incidents"
❌ "show data"
❌ "what's happening"
```

### Interpreting Responses

1. **Start with Key Findings** - Get the numbers first
2. **Read Insights** - Understand the "why"
3. **Check Recommendations** - Know what to do
4. **Reference Summary** - Quick recap

## 🔍 Example Queries & Responses

### Query: "Show top 5 departments by incident count"

**Response**:
```markdown
## 📊 Key Findings

- **Operations**: 342 incidents (27.4% of total)
- **Manufacturing**: 289 incidents (23.2%)
- **Logistics**: 178 incidents (14.3%)
- **Maintenance**: 156 incidents (12.5%)
- **Quality Control**: 134 incidents (10.7%)

## 💡 Insights

- Top 3 departments account for **64.9%** of all incidents
- Operations and Manufacturing are high-risk due to:

## 🧪 Testing Formatted Responses

### Test in WebSocket

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8000/ws/agent/stream?question=Show top incidents&model=google/gemini-flash-1.5:free');

ws.onmessage = (event) => {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
    
    if (data.type === 'answer_complete') {
        console.log('Formatted Response:');
        console.log(data.content);
        
        // Check for sections
        const hasSections = data.content.includes('## 📊');
        console.log('Properly formatted:', hasSections);
    }
};
```

### Test Formatting Function

```python
from app.services.tool_agent import enhance_response_formatting

# Test with unformatted response
response = "There are 342 incidents in Operations department."
formatted = enhance_response_formatting(response)
print(formatted)

# Output:
# ## 📊 Analysis Results
# 
# There are 342 incidents in Operations department.
# 
# ## 📋 Summary
# Analysis completed successfully. See findings above for detailed insights.
```
