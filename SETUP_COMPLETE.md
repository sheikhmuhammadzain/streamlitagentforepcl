## 🔧 Free AI Models Available

Change model in `test_websocket.html` line 320:

```javascript
// Grok (good for complex reasoning, but rate limited)
&model=x-ai/grok-code-fast-1

// Gemini (most stable, recommended)
&model=google/gemini-flash-1.5:free

// Qwen (fast, good balance)
&model=qwen/qwen-2.5-7b-instruct:free

// Llama (popular, reliable)
&model=meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:free

// Mistral (fast inference)
&model=mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct:free
```

## 📊 Example Session

**User:** "Show top 5 departments with most incidents"

**AI Response:**
```
🤖 Starting...
🤔 Thinking... I need to get the incident data structure first

🔧 Tool Call: get_data_summary
Arguments: {"sheet_name": "incident"}

✅ Tool Result:
{
  "sheet": "incident",
  "rows": 1234,
  "columns": ["department", "severity", ...],
  ...
}

🤔 Thinking... Now I'll aggregate by department

🔧 Tool Call: aggregate_data  
Arguments: {
  "sheet_name": "incident",
  "group_by": "department",
  "operation": "count"
}

✅ Tool Result:
{
  "results": {
    "Operations": 342,
    "Maintenance": 256,
    "Production": 198,
    ...
  }
}

💬 Answer:
Based on the data analysis, here are the top 5 departments 
with the most incidents:

1. **Operations** - 342 incidents (27.7%)
2. **Maintenance** - 256 incidents (20.7%)  
3. **Production** - 198 incidents (16.0%)
4. **Logistics** - 145 incidents (11.7%)
5. **Quality** - 123 incidents (10.0%)

**Key Insights:**
- Operations has significantly more incidents
- Top 5 account for 86% of all incidents
- Focus safety efforts on these high-risk areas
